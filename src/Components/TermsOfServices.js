                <h1>Parts of this Agreement</h1>
                <p>This Agreement consists of the following terms and conditions (hereinafter the “General Terms”)
and terms and conditions.</p>
                <h1>Acceptance of the Terms</h1>
                <p>You must be of legal age to enter into a binding agreement in order to accept the Terms. If you
do not agree to the General Terms, do not use any of our Services. You can accept the Terms by
checking a checkbox or clicking on a button indicating your acceptance of the terms or by
actually using the Services.</p>
                    <h1>Description of Service</h1>
                    <p>We provide an array of services for online business web and application (&quot;Service&quot; or
&quot;Services&quot;). You may use the Services for your personal and business use or for internal business
purpose in the organization that you represent. You may connect to the Services using any
Internet browser supported by the Services. You are responsible for obtaining access to the
Internet and the equipment necessary to use the Services. You can create and edit content with
your user account and if you choose to do so, you can publish and share such content..</p>
            <h1>Modification of Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>We may modify the Terms upon notice to you at any time through a service announcement or by
sending email to your primary email address. If we make significant changes to the Terms that
affect your rights, you will be provided with at least 30 days advance notice of the changes by
email to your primary email address. You may terminate your use of the Services by providing
THE PROVIDER notice by email within 30 days of being notified of the availability of the

modified Terms if the Terms are modified in a manner that substantially affects your rights in
connection with use of the Services. In the event of such termination, you will be entitled to
prorated refund of the unused portion of any prepaid fees. Your continued use of the Service
after the effective date of any change to the Terms will be deemed to be your agreement to the
modified Terms.</p>
            <h1>User Sign up Obligations</h1>
            <p>You need to sign up for a user account by providing all required information in order to access or
use the Services. If you represent an organization and wish to use the Services for corporate
internal use, we recommend that you, and all other users from your organization, sign up for user
accounts by providing your corporate contact information. In particular, we recommend that you
use your corporate email address. You agree to: a) provide true, accurate, current and complete
information about yourself as prompted by the sign up process; and b) maintain and promptly
update the information provided during sign up to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If
you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, or if THE
PROVIDER has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate,
outdated, or incomplete, THE PROVIDER may terminate your user account and refuse current
or future use of any or all of the Services, upon which all fees and payments are due (any and all
pending transactions will be cancelled).</p>
            <h1>Organization Accounts and Administrators</h1>
            <p>When you sign up for an account for your organization you may specify one or more
administrators. The administrators will have the right to configure the Services based on your
requirements and manage end users in your organization account. If your organization account is
created and configured on your behalf by a third party, it is likely that such third party has
assumed administrator role for your organization. Make sure that you enter into a suitable
agreement with such third party specifying such party’s roles and restrictions as an administrator
of your organization account.
You are responsible for i) ensuring confidentiality of your organization account password, ii)
appointing competent individuals as administrators for managing your organization account, and
iii) ensuring that all activities that occur in connection with your organization account comply
with this Agreement. You understand that THE PROVIDER is not responsible for account
administration and internal management of the Services for you.
You are responsible for taking necessary steps for ensuring that your organization does not lose
control of the administrator accounts. You may specify a process to be followed for recovering
control in the event of such loss of control of the administrator accounts by sending an email
to treasure.trove.nyc@gmail.com, provided that the process is acceptable to THE PROVIDER.
In the absence of any specified administrator account recovery process, THE PROVIDER may
provide control of an administrator account to an individual providing proof satisfactory to THE
PROVIDER demonstrating authorization to act on behalf of the organization. You agree not to
hold THE PROVIDER liable for the consequences of any action taken by THE PROVIDER in
good faith in this regard..</p>
                <h1>Personal Information and Privacy</h1>
                <p>Personal information you provide to THE PROVIDER through the Service is governed by THE
PROVIDER PRIVACY POLICY. Your election to use the Service indicates your acceptance of
the terms of the PROVIDER PRIVACY POLICY. You are responsible for maintaining
confidentiality of your username, password and other sensitive information. You are responsible
for all activities that occur in your user account and you agree to inform us immediately of any
unauthorized use of your user account by email to treasure.trove.nyc@gmail.com. We are not
responsible for any loss or damage to you or to any third party incurred as a result of any
unauthorized access and/or use of your user account, or otherwise.</p>
                <h1>Communications from THE PROVIDER</h1>
                <p>The Service may include certain communications from THE PROVIDER, such as service
announcements, administrative messages and newsletters. You understand that these
communications shall be considered part of using the Services. As part of our policy to provide
you total privacy, we also provide you the option of opting out from receiving newsletters from
us. However, you will not be able to opt-out from receiving service announcements and
administrative messages..</p>
                <h1>Complaints</h1>
                <p>If we receive a complaint from any person against you with respect to your activities as part of
use of the Services, we will investigate the issue throughly and take appropriate action (we
reserve the right to suspend or terminate your accounts for any reason).</p>
        <h1>Spamming and Illegal Activities</h1>
        <p>You agree to be solely responsible for the contents of your transmissions through the Services.
You agree not to use the Services for illegal purposes or for the transmission of material that is
unlawful, defamatory, harassing, libelous, invasive of another&#39;s privacy, abusive, threatening,
harmful, vulgar, pornographic, obscene, or is otherwise objectionable, offends religious
sentiments, promotes racism, contains viruses or malicious code, or that which infringes or may
infringe intellectual property or other rights of another. You agree not to use the Services for the

transmission of &quot;junk mail&quot;, &quot;spam&quot;, &quot;chain letters&quot;, “phishing” or unsolicited mass distribution
of email. We reserve the right to terminate your access to the Services if there are reasonable
grounds to believe that you have used the Services for any illegal or unauthorized activity.</p>
        <h1>Inactive User Accounts Policy</h1>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate unpaid user accounts that are inactive for a continuous period
of 120 days. In the event of such termination, all data associated with such user account will be
deleted. We will provide you prior notice of such termination and option to back-up your data.
The data deletion policy may be implemented with respect to any or all of the Services. Each
Service will be considered an independent and separate service for the purpose of calculating the
period of inactivity. In other words, activity in one of the Services is not sufficient to keep your
user account in another Service active. In case of accounts with more than one user, if at least
one of the users is active, the account will not be considered inactive.</p>
        <h1>Data Ownership</h1>
        <p>You are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing your User Content at your
sole cost and expense. You acknowledge and agree that The Provider is not responsible for any
errors or omissions that you make in connection with the Services. By submitting or posting User
Content, you hereby grant to The Provider a non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, perpetual,
irrevocable, sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, sell, create
derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display the User Content, and your name,
company name, location and any other information you submit with the User Content, in
connection with the Services. The use of your or any other User’s name, likeness, or identity in
connection with the The Provider and/or Services does not imply any endorsement thereof unless
explicitly stated otherwise. We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party
who is claiming that any content posted by you constitutes a violation of their intellectual
property rights, or of their right to privacy.</p>
        <h1>User Generated Content</h1>
        <p>You may transmit or publish content created by you using any of the Services or otherwise.
However, you shall be solely responsible for such content and the consequences of its
transmission or publication. Any content made public will be publicly accessible through the
internet and may be crawled and indexed by search engines. You are responsible for ensuring
that you do not accidentally make any private content publicly available. Any content that you
may receive from other users of the Services, is provided to you AS IS for your information and
personal use only and you agree not to use, copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast,
display, sell, license or otherwise exploit such content for any purpose, without the express
written consent of the person who owns the rights to such content. In the course of using any of
the Services, if you come across any content with copyright notice(s) or any copy protection
feature(s), you agree not to remove such copyright notice(s) or disable such copy protection
feature(s) as the case may be. By making any copyrighted/copyrightable content available on any
of the Services you affirm that you have the consent, authorization or permission, as the case
may be from every person who may claim any rights in such content to make such content

available in such manner. Further, by making any content available in the manner
aforementioned, you expressly agree that THE PROVIDER will have the right to block access to
or remove such content made available by you if THE PROVIDER receives complaints
concerning any illegality or infringement of third party rights in such content. By using any of
the Services and transmitting or publishing any content using such Service, you expressly
consent to determination of questions of illegality or infringement of third party rights in such
content by the agent designated by THE PROVIDER for this purpose.</p>
