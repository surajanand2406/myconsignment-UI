                <h1>1. Aspects under the tutelage of this policy.</h1>
                <p>We currently work with the mobile applications of the Provider (the "Application"), as well as
the websites My Consignment (myconsignment.co), Mi Consignación (miconsignación.com,
miconsignacion.com), Pure Artisan (pureartisan.co), Pure Artesanal (puroartesanal.com), Alberto

covers all aspects of the services.
According to the regulations of the Organic Law 15/99 of December 13, Protection of Personal
Data, you are informed that all personal data provided through the applications and the websites

                <h1>2. What personal information do we collect from you?</h1>
                <p>2.1. We need to collect personal data for our suppliers through the Services indicated in this
Policy. This information may include your name, email address, mailing address, date of birth,
gender, and photos. We also need to receive your personal data from other sources, such as
public databases, marketing partners, social networking platforms (including the list of your
friends or other people with whom you are linked) and other third parties.
You can use our application and visit our website without providing your personal information.
We are careful to collect your personal data in order to provide certain services. If you refuse to
provide your personal information when required, the application may not be able to provide
certain services (for example, by marking your account as "verified"). You may choose to
purchase certain additional functionalities, in Supplier, in relation to the Services. If you do so,
we require you to use personal information to provide services related to that purchase. By 
sending us or our service providers personal data concerning others in connection with the
Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and that you allow us to use the
information in accordance with this privacy policy.
2.2. It is required to collect the physical location of the device in order to record and post
information about your position and show you the products offered by users near you. Provider
can collect this information, for example, with satellite signals, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi. You
may allow or deny such collection and publication of the location of your device, but may affect
your use of the Services (for example, making it impossible for us to put your products for sale
in a certain geographic location).
2.3 It is required to use any advertisement published by a Supplier, including the uploaded photo
or product image, as well as other information (including the user name and location) associated
with the advertisement, for our own advertising purposes, including social networks, Facebook
ads, newsletters and announcements of any means of communication.
2.4. It is possible to reveal the personal data we obtain from you to our affiliates for the purposes
described in this Privacy Policy; to our service providers that provide services such as website
hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment, information technology and the
provision of related infrastructure, customer service, email service, auditing and others services;
and a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment,
transfer or other disposition of all or part of our business, assets or shares.
2.5 We require to use or disclose the personal data we obtain from you, in the event that we
deem it necessary or appropriate, including, but not limited to, the use and disclosure of personal
data for the following purposes: protect the person or organization, to protect our services, rights
or property, to comply with legal requirements, to respond to a legal process or legal application
requests and to comply with requests from other public and governmental authorities.
2.6 It is required to add personal data, which I do not add personally identifies you or any other
user of the Services. For example, we need to add personal data to calculate the percentage of
our users who have a particular zip code.</p>
                    <h1>3. High and Creation</h1>
                    <p>3.1. To manage some of our services you will have to register, either by providing your email
address or your social network account. We also need to collect information that includes your

your preferred method of communication). In case you decide to register with a social network
account, you authorize us to access and use certain information depending on the privacy settings
you have selected in that social network. Thus, we indicate a few examples of personal data that
we collect and use that include basic account information (for example, name, email address,
gender, date of birth, current city, profile picture, user ID) , list of friends, etc.) and any other
additional information or activities that you allow the social network to share.
3.2. Possibly it is required to provide personal data such as a profile image, name and surname,

features of those areas without registering.
3.3. All the information requested in the forms of the application that do not appear as optional
are mandatory for the purpose of effectively managing the relationship with the Supplier.</p>
            <h1>4. Public Data</h1>
            <p>4.1. We must bear in mind that any information that you publish in the Provider, will be visible
and may be available to other users, and the general public. We urge you to be very careful when
deciding what information you will disclose through the Services.
4.2. You should also bear in mind that the username and your public photo will be available to
the public by participating in some services, such as the publication of items for sale, so we
recommend discretion and prudence in using the Services. Personal data sent by you or disclosed
by you to other users may be collected by other users of these services and may result in
unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for protecting the information that you disclose to
third parties through our services (for example, sending your phone number to another user

subscription that are included in such emails. Keep in mind that even if you opt to stop receiving
commercial communications, you can continue to receive administrative communications from
the Provider, such as transaction confirmations, notifications about your account activities (for
example, account confirmations, password changes, etc.), and any other important
announcements. We also need to send you push notifications if you have activated it. You can
disable push notifications in the settings of your mobile device.</p>

following section.
6.3. We also require that you collect information when you voluntarily provide it, as your
preferred method of communication.
6.4 We need to add personal information, which when added does not personally identify you or
any other user of the Services. For example, we need to collect personal data to calculate the
percentage of our users who have a particular zip code. We require you to use and disclose
aggregate personal data for any purpose, except when we are required to do so in another manner
according to applicable law.
6.5. We require you to use and disclose non-personal information for any purpose, except when
we are required to do so in another way according to applicable law. In some cases, we need to
combine this information with personal data. For example, if you have created an account with
our services, your account information may be related to items of your purchase (for example,
your order history). If we do, we will treat the combined information as personal information, as
long as it remains combined.</p>

or service to which the Services offered here link.
We also need to use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the
Provider. If you wish to make a payment through the Provider, your personal data may be
collected by said third party and not by us, and will be subject to the privacy policy of the third
party, instead of this privacy policy. We have no control over it, and we are not responsible for
the collection, use and disclosure of such personal data by this third party.</p>
        <h1>11. Period of Protection of the information</h1>

email or application of the existence of a new policy and / or the publication of the new policy on
the Services. All changes to the policy will be effective upon posting, and your continued use of
